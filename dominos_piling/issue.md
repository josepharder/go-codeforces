**Time limit per test:** 2 seconds  
**Memory limit per test:** 256 megabytes  

You are given a rectangular board of size **M** × **N** squares and an unlimited supply of 2×1 domino pieces. You can rotate the pieces. Your goal is to place as many dominoes as possible under these conditions:

1. Each domino covers exactly two adjacent squares.  
2. No two dominoes overlap.  
3. Each domino must lie entirely within the board.

**Find the maximum number of dominoes** that can fit without violating these conditions.

## Input
A single line with two integers `M` and `N` (1 ≤ M ≤ N ≤ 16).

## Output
A single integer — the maximal number of dominoes that can be placed.
